I'm a maths grad, but in my applied maths studies, we've been mainly focused about machine learning and statistics, and we've not been able to cover Deep Learning. As I am still looking for a job at the time of writing this blog spot, I figured I would try to learn Deep Learning, so that I can put it on my resume (but I'm really interesting in this topic too, so win-win).\n",
